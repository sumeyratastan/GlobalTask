I used Selenium to automate my browser.
Maven is my build automation tool.
My framework is Java-Selenium-Cucumber based on Page Object Model (POM) which supports Data Driven Test(DDT) 
and Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)approach.
I wrote scenarios using the Gherkin language in the .feature file to implement BDD.

The tests are run in the cukes runner class under the runner package.
